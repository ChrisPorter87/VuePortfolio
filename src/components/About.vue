    <p class="mx-auto">
      My name is Chris Porter and I'm a former chef turned full stack web
      developer. Although a very different career path, there are still plenty
      of transferrable traits such as my ability to make decisions under
      pressure, and my ability to remain calm under pressure. I'm very
      personable, and fit in well with any team. I'm very professional, with a
      strong work ethic, but also like to bring a light heartedness to the
      table, to make work a little bit more enjoyable for everyone. I appreciate
      you taking the time to check out my portfolio and look forward to working
      with you!
