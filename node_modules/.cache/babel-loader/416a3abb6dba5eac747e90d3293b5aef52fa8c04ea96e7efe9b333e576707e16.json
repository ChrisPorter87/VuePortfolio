Although a very different career path, there are still plenty\n      of transferrable traits such as my ability to make decisions under\n      pressure, and my ability to remain calm under pressure. I'm very\n      personable, and fit in well with any team. I'm very professional, with a\n      strong work ethic, but also like to bring a light heartedness to the\n      table, to make work a little bit more enjoyable for everyone. I appreciate\n      you taking the time to check out my portfolio and look forward to working\n      with you!\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport { defineComponent } from \"vue\";\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  name: \"about-page\",\n  setup() {},\n});\n</script>\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
